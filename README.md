## Inspiration
Do you need an api? Are you tired of AWS and it complicated UI? A lot of the time, you just need an API link to run your Python code. With !Backend (not backend), this is possible.

## What it does
!Backend runs in the following steps:
  
  + Ask for URL input for GitHub public repository
  + Send URL to a Python webserver
  + Webserver starts a new instance for every function
  + Webserver returns API URL

After the whole process, you should have a URL that runs your Python API.
